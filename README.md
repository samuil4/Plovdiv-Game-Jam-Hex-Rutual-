In order to set the order of turns for the players, each member of a team needs to roll a dice. The player with the highest received value is a first, followed by the next highest value and so forth. It's important that, once the turns inside the team are set, the player, who has the last turn, needs to switch one of his heroes for the "Anarchist" hero, who is needed for team, in order to make the sacred ritual at the end of the game. After the internal turns of a team are ready, the first players from each team needs to roll the dice in order to determine, whose team will be first, again the team with the highest score is first.      

The first player of the team starts, followed by the first player of the opposing team. After this goes the second and third team members, following the same logic.

WINNING THE GAME
In order to win the game a team needs to perform "The ritual of the six sacred cards".    

For this the 6 sacred cards needs to be collected from the sacred fields, the player gets a single sacred card. A sacred field contains only one sacred card and afterwards doesn't provide any more sacred cards. The ritual can be performed only by the player who has the "Anarchist" hero and also has the 6 sacred cards in his or her possession. For this reason players can transfer sacred cards to each other, only and when they are on one and the same "path" of the map.

The first team with a player holding the "Anarchist" hero, who has also the 6 sacred cards in his or her possession can perform "The ritual of the six sacred cards" and therefore wins the game.
